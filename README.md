Win the Toss, Win the Match? Whinge or Reality?

Mere whinging, or does the toss really have a significant effect on the result? A stat confirms that if the toss itself has no effect, one would expect the winner of the toss to win the match 50% of the time. The team winning the toss does better than this, i.e. 54 % of the time. To prove this I have analyzed Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset from 2008-2022. Being from Mumbai (India), I have analyzed all the seasons Mumbai Indians (MI) have won. Upon analyzing, MI have won maximum number of tosses when they have won the season.
